# ✨ The Spot ✨
Our mobile app is a simple decentralized advertising platform that relies on private
property for spread. By utilizing private property, we are able to provide a more efficient
and cost-effective way to advertise compared to traditional methods. Our app allows users
to place ads on their own property and then share those ads with others in the community.

✅  user controlled prices and dynamic interest rates

✅  full transparency due to the CSC smart chain contract

✅ easy to use system enabled by tactile feedback
